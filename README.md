# Music Analysis

Using machine learning / artificial intelligence algorithms to translate audio files into a computerized music score (Project 1) and taking in a sound from the microphone and then returning the note that the sound corresponds with (Project 2)

## Libraries Used:
```
pydub : open-source package for audio manipulation in Python. Pydub uses ffmpeg or libav under the hood for audio 
        manipulation. We will use Pydub to read the audio file and apply different audio effects on it.
```

```
These libraries are used hand-in-hand:

pandas : used for data preparation and manipulation
sklearn : provides machine learning algorithms and tools
matplotlib : helps visualize the data and results. 
```

```
wave : is a built-in library that provides functionalities for working with WAV audio files. The wave module 
       allows you to read and write WAV files, retrieve information about the audio file, and manipulate audio 
       data.
```

```
librosa : audio analysis and feature extraction. It provides a wide range of tools and functionalities to work 
          with audio data in various forms. Librosa is commonly used in fields such as music information retrieval,
          audio signal processing, and machine learning.  
          
Functionalitites : Audio Loading, Spectrogram and Feature Extraction, Beat and Tempo Estimation, Harmonic and 
                   Percussive Separation, Time Series Analysis, Visualization
```

```
scipy : open-source Python library used for scientific and technical computing. It provides a collection of 
        numerical algorithms and tools built on top of the NumPy library. SciPy is designed to work with arrays
        and matrices and offers a wide range of functions for mathematical operations, optimization, signal and
        image processing, statistics, linear algebra, and more.
